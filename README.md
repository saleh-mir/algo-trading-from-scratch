## Usage
Assuming that you already have installed the environment dependencies, you can run the following command to create your project:

```sh
# 1. go into the root directory of the project
# 2. to create a .env file of yours
cp .env.example .env
```

Then while in the project run:

```sh
cd docker
docker-compose up
```

That's it! Now open [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) in your browser to see the dashboard.
